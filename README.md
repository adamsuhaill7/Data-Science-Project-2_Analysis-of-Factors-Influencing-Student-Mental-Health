## Introduction

In today's fast-paced academic environment, the mental health of students has become an increasingly pressing concern. As a student myself, I have witnessed firsthand the impact of academic pressures, work commitments, and personal challenges on mental well-being. This analysis aims to explore the relationship between various factors such as academic pressure, sleep duration, and dietary habits, and their influence on students' mental health indicators, including depression and suicidal thoughts.

### Primary Objectives of This Analysis
