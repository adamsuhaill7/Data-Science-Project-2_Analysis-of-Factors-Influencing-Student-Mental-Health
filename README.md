## Description
Hello GitHub enthusiasts!!! My name is Adam, and I'm a master's student in Data Science. I have decided to explore and analyze this dataset because being a student myself, I am keenly aware of the challenges we face regarding mental health and academic pressures.

The dataset focuses on the mental health and lifestyle factors of students across various cities in India and contains tens of thousands of records. Each record captures a wide range of demographic, academic, and psychological variables.

- **Age**: The age of the students.
- **City**: The city where the students reside.
- **Profession**: The profession of the students, primarily categorized as 'Student'.
- **Academic Pressure**: A rating indicating the level of academic pressure experienced by the students (scale of 1 to 5).
- **Work Pressure**: A rating indicating the level of work pressure (scale of 0 to 5).
- **CGPA**: The cumulative grade point average of the students.

I believe this dataset is particularly significant as it highlights the mental health challenges that students in India encounter. By analyzing these factors, I hope to contribute to a better understanding of student well-being and to foster discussions around the necessary support systems we need in academic environments.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To identify trends in mental health issues among students based on age, gender, dietary habits, and lifestyle factors.
